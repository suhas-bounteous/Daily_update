# 📌 Daily Update

Welcome to **Daily Update** — a structured repository to track daily learning, coding practice, and project development.

This repository currently contains Java practice (Assignments, DSA, Lecture notes) and is designed to scale in the future with full-stack projects using **React** and **Spring Boot**.

## 🏗 Future Monorepo Structure

Once frontend and backend are added, the structure may evolve into:

```
Daily_update/
│
├── java-practice/
├── react-frontend/
├── springboot-backend/
└── README.md
```

This will make it a complete full-stack learning repository.
